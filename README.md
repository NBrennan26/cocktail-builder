The Odin Project Javascript Capstone Project - Cocktail Assistant

The original project calls for a clone of a website. I thought this would be a great opportunity to attempt to build my own website from scratch. This cocktail website is something I've thought about for a bit, and I will attempt to implement some features I've never used before.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Firebase

## Future Plans

- Add Register/Login Project

- Add ability to save Cocktails
- Add filter/search
